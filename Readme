A 48 hour collaborative programming effort of Feni, Jim, Peter and Victor for the Global Game Jam competition, 2010. 

The concept is that you are a planet floating through space. As you collect dust particles floating around, you gain mass. As you bump into bigger planets, the collision may causes both of you to loose mass. The player can navigate space by ejecting it's own mass, kind of like how throwing a brick out the back of a spaceship can propel it. Be careful though, moving too much may cause you to loose too much mass and disappear completly.
